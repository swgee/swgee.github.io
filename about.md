Hello! My name is Ben, I am an InfoSec practitioner passionate about all things tech. In my current role as a Senior Offensive Security Engineer at [Praetorian](https://www.praetorian.com), I perform advanced product security testing for leading organizations in finance, healthcare, manufacturing, software, and other industries.

I started this blog as a method of capturing information on topics I want to learn more about. Such topics include, but are not limited to, security architecture, vulnerability research, new developments in tech, and cyber warfare. My goal for this blog is to channel my learning into a creative and structured output while also sharing the knowledge with others.

In my personal life, I am a husband and father and love going on family adventures, hiking :mountain_snow:, running, playing basketball :basketball:, and getting involved in my church community.

Thanks for visiting - please feel free to reach out and let me know what you think!
