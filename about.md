Hello and welcome! My name is Ben, I am an InfoSec practitioner who is passionate about all things tech. In my current role as a Senior Offensive Security Engineer at [Praetorian](https://www.praetorian.com), I perform advanced product security testing for leading organizations in finance, healthcare, manufacturing, software, and other industries.

I started this blog as a method of capturing information on topics I want to learn more about. Such topics include, but are not limited to, security architecture, vulnerability research, new developments in tech, and cyber warfare. My goal for this blog is to channel my learning into a creative and structured output, while also sharing the knowledge with others.

Technical skills and knowledge are essential to succeed in InfoSec and other specialized disciplines. However, as artificial intelligence continues to develop and obtain the capabilities of human engineers/analysts/developers, I'm willing to wager that having a strong grasp of overarching concepts in technology and society as whole will pay off long term as more digital tasks are automated away. So in essence, this blog is also an investment in my own preparedness for the future, which is approaching fast :slightly_smiling_face:.

In my personal life, I am a husband and father and love going on family adventures, hiking :mountain_snow:, running, playing basketball :basketball:, and getting involved in my church community.

Thanks for visiting - please feel free to connect and let me know what you think!
