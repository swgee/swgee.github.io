My name is Ben Kofman, I am currently working at [Praetorian](https://www.praetorian.com/) as a Senior Offensive Security Engineer focused on advanced product security testing for leading organizations in industries including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and technology.

I started this blog as a way to capture information on interesting topics that I strive to learn more about. Such topics include, but are not limited to, security architecture, vulnerability research, new developments in tech, and cyber warfare. While my goal for this blog is to guide my personal learning journey into a creative and structured output, it would be awesome to inform and entertain others as well.

Thanks for visiting, please feel free to connect with me and let me know what you think! :robot:
