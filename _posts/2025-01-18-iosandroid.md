## Introduction

Mobile security is a niche field in the world of Information Security. Where much of cybersecurity focuses on securing enterprise environments and applications, mobile security professionals focus on protecting individuals and their data from compromise, as individuals are the primary consumers of mobile technology. Of course there are corporate-issued smartphones and internal applications, but these make up a relatively tiny fraction of the enterprise attack surface. The primary goal of mobile vulnerability researchers, malware reverse engineers, and application penetration testers is to secure the devices that so many people trust to store and process their most sensitive and personal information. 

Smartphones constitute arguably the greatest digital attack surface in modern society: over half the global population and most people in the developed world own one. Mobile applications are heavily relied on for everything we do, be it communication, banking, media, navigation, photos, etc. The average person spends four to five hours a day using their phone. They are a part of us. We are cyborgs without a physical link between our mechanical and biological components.

The two dominant platforms are Android and iOS. Combined, 99.5% of smart phones run either operating system - and there are no other legitimate choices supported by the majority of app developers. Android dominates the global market share at about 73.5%, with iOS coming in at 26%.

This article will explore the primary distinctions between the two platforms, focusing on their characteristics, architectures, and vulnerabilities. The difference between the two operating systems can be summarized as followed:

Android is like the Wild West - a lawless place where everyone is armed. iOS is like a walled garden where your protection is entirely dependent on those walls.

## The smartphone market
iOS is obviously the operating system running on iPhones and iPads, the handheld devices produced by Apple. For Americans, it may come as a surprise that they only own about a quarter of the global smartphone market share, as previously stated. In America, Apple controls a bit more than half of the market share. And because only one company produces the phones and software, it may appear that iPhones are by and large the more dominant product - an illusion created by their uniformity. However, the market for Android phones is larger throughout the world than iPhones, and only slightly less in the United States. But it is a fragmented ecosystem with many device manufacturers. 

There are 58 companies recognized by Google as official Android device manufacturers listed on the (Android Enterprise)[https://androidenterprisepartners.withgoogle.com/device-manufacturers/] website. Of those, the four leading manufacturers worldwide are Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, and OPPO. In the U.S., Google trails Samsung with their Pixel line. Of the five OEMs (original equipment manufacturer) mentioned, only Samsung and Google Pixel use the stock Android OS developed by Google. The other three mentioned are Chinese manufacturers that install their own customized versions of Android - specifically Xiaomi's HyperOS, Vivo's Funtouch OS, and Oppo's ColorOS. Some organizations build devices running Android for purposes other than personal phones, such as Honeywell, which has an entire line of ("Mobile Handheld Computers")[https://automation.honeywell.com/us/en/products/productivity-solutions/mobile-computers/handheld-computers] built for industrial use cases. This diversity in the Android device marketplace leads to the discussion about an important factor fpr evaluating mobile operating systems: security patching.
