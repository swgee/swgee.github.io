title: Building a Custom Baby Monitor for Fun and Sleep

### Background

My wife and I were in the market for a new baby monitor. We were looking for something that had a delay wake feature, where the monitor turns on after detecting noise for at least a period of time, for example 60 seconds. The monitor we used for our daughter's first year was a [HelloBaby](https://www.amazon.com/Monitor-5Display-Pan-Tilt-Zoom-Temperature-Lullabies/dp/B09GM8JZM9) - a non-wifi, radio-frequency paired camera and 5-inch tablet. The HelloBaby has a VOX (Voice Activated Alert) feature which turns on the screen and volume when it detects noise over a certain level. However, there are only three levels to choose from, and the monitor turns on instantly and does not support delays.

There are a few reasons delay alert would be a useful feature in a baby monitor:

* Chirps/screeches: Some babies are noisy sleepers and occasionally let out a single cry then go back to sleep. If you struggle with falling back to sleep after being woken up, these random battle cries can interrupt what would have been a quality night of sleep.
* Babies get bigger: The VOX levels for the HelloBaby used to work well when our daughter was a newborn. Level three would only activate if she was crying really hard, so we usually set it at level two. However, as she grew, her voice also got louder. So the monitor activates even if she makes pretty much any sound, happy or sad, even at level three.
* Sleep training: Eventually, babies may need to be sleep-trained, which involves letting them cry for periods of about 10 minutes before going in to soothe them again, teaching them to eventually fall asleep on their own. A delay alert feature with a cooldown timer would allow parents to sleep train without listening to their baby crying all night, and maybe even get a few minutes of sleep in between soothings. 

We tried to find a monitor with this feature but couldn't find anything online. My guess for this is that manufacturers don't want to be liable for a misconfigured delay, resulting in parents not being woken up. So either the monitor turns on, or it's turned off (or a monitor is not used at all). After using a standard monitor for a year, we knew our daughter's sleeping habits and knew how a delay alert monitor should be configured and that it would be very helpful. So, we took things into our own hands and built one ourselves.

IF you are a new parent, do not build your own baby monitor or use one you found on a random blog. If you are going to use a monitor, buy one from a reputable manufacturer with solid reviews and no recalls (and preferably non-wifi for optimal privacy). Once you understand your child's sleeping habits, then you can carefully experiment with optimal monitoring strategies to improve sleep for you and your child.

### Exploring the options

Initially, I wanted to build a monitor from semi-scratch, assembling the major parts such as the computer, camera, and microphone in a single unit to place in the kid's room. The video and audio feed could be accessed via a web site, with a page to modify the delay wake settings and maybe also control the camera via PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom).
